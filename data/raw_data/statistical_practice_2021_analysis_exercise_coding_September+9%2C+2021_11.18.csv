Given the confidence interval, I would wager that in spite of a failure to reject the null hypothesis at a conventional alpha level (𝛼 = .05), there is likely a true negative relationship at the population level. It is almost certainly a weak one, though. I would not attribute much clinical significance to a decrease in anxiety of 1.3 points for every hour spent with a pet.
